<p>Here in Module 5, we begin a unit in which we shift our focus to literary connections to New Orleans by way of two modern classics – Tennessee Williams’ one-act play Suddenly, Last Summer and Kate Chopin’s short novel The Awakening. We’ll get to The Awakening in Modules 7 and 8; right now, we concentrate on the Williams play. To facilitate that, we have two texts, one print and one televisual. Below you will find a YouTube link to a fine BBC performance of the play done in the early 90s which features the great actresses Natasha Richardson and Maggie Smith in key roles. I have also posted, to the Course Q&A Discussion, a pdf of the text of the play. I recommend you watch the play first; then, if you like, you can go back and read it. (And if you choose, as part of your Midterm assignment – due at the end of Week 6 – to write about the play, you should definitely read as well as screen it.) </p>
<p>And a quick note: For your purposes you should definitely deal with the one-act play – which the BBC production faithfully reproduces – as opposed to the movie of the same name, starring Elizabeth Taylor, Katherine Hepburn and Montgomery Clift, which came out in 1959. The movie provides an experience of its own, but it’s an <em>adaptation</em> of Williams’ play – one of which he disapproved because, among other transgressions, it added material that’s not in the play. </p>
<p>Before we get to the play though, I want to provide some background on its author, its setting and a story that can be seen as one of the play’s intertexts. No doubt that word “intertext” is a new one for you: It comes out of literary studies and it refers to a phenomenon called <em>intertextuality</em> – and yes, I know, that’s yet another term that needs unpacking. The basic idea is that literary works – whether they be plays, poems or novels – often interact, so to speak, not just with an audience, or emotions, or the intellect, or history, or the “real” world – but with other literary texts. When one text bears such a relation to another text, the other text is called the first one’s intertext. Sometimes authors set up intertextual relations quite deliberately. For example, it’s clear that the screenwriters of the classic 1982 sci fi film <em>Blade Runner</em> had in mind, as an intertext, Mary Shelley’s 1818 novel <em>Frankenstein</em>. The film’s subtle allusions and thematic similarity to Shelley’s novel put <em>Blade Runner</em> in, so to speak, dialogue with <em>Frankenstein</em>. <em>Frankenstein</em> helps shape <em>Blade Runner</em> in certain ways; meanwhile, a viewer who has read <em>Frankenstein</em> may have her/his sense or understanding of the novel changed or enhanced by the movie. And this is a good way to think about intertextuality. It’s like two stories are in a dialogue, debate or conversation with each other.</p>

<h3>Who was Tennessee Williams?</h3>
<p>But to return to our author: Thomas Lanier “Tennessee” Williams (1911-1983) is one of the giants of 20th century drama, the author of such groundbreaking plays as <em>A Streetcar Named Desire</em> (set, like <em>Suddenly, Last Summer</em>, in New Orleans), <em>The Glass Menagerie</em>, and <em>Cat On A Hot Tin Roof</em>. He wrote numerous other plays, some of them highly experimental, as well as poems, short stories and memoirs. His stage works were distinguished by their richly textured, emotionally nuanced and often dysfunctional characters, his feel for authentic-sounding dialogue, his contrasting flair for the poetic when it came to descriptions, the yearning for transcendence that many of his characters embody, as well as his controversial exploration of themes of sexuality, including frank – and for their time, shocking depictions of – sexual violence, violence against women and homosexuality. Due to this latter quality, his plays were often initially greeted by calls for censorship and denunciations of their author as a degenerate. The sheer artistic power of the plays often carried the day though and many have become classics of the theater.  </p>
<p><img src="https://64parishes.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/tennessee-williams_portrait.jpg" alt="Tennessee Williams"></p>
<p>Williams was born in Columbus, Mississippi, into a deeply dysfunctional family: his father, a traveling salesman, was literally and figuratively distant, and when home and drinking heavily, abusive to both Williams and his mother. His mother was a snobbish Southern belle who was obsessed with social status. Williams was, however, very close to his older sister Rose, whom he held dear, but who was diagnosed with schizophrenia as a young adult. At the age of 24, Rose was committed to a mental institution, where she spent the rest of her life. It is often said that Laura Wingfield, the shy, physically disabled and fantasy-prone main character of William’s first successful play, <em>The Glass Menagerie</em>, is based on Rose. </p>
<p>While she was committed, Rose was subjected to a medical operation, authorized by her mother, called a prefrontal lobotomy – a practice which was considered cutting-edge neuroscience at the time, but which today is generally considered barbaric, if not criminal. Lobotomy was a procedure in which long needles were inserted, by way of the nasal cavities or the eye sockets, into the frontal lobes of the brain, so as to sever the nerve pathways in the lobes from other parts of the brain (Britannica). It was reserved for patients whose condition was considered intractable – that is, unresponsive to any other treatment – and whose behavior was judged highly disruptive and/or violent. Typically, after a lobotomy, such a patient would be calm and docile. However, in losing their previous antisocial impulses and orientations, they also often lost their personalities, seeming like zombies with little to no emotion or intellectual functioning. Williams never got over the effect the lobotomy had on his beloved sister. When he died in 1983, Tennessee left the bulk of his fortune to pay for his sister’s care. </p>

<h3>Williams and New Orleans </h3>
<p>In 1938, the 27-year old Williams visited New Orleans and fell in love with the French Quarter, which at the time was no longer the home of the Creoles of color and nor was it the upscale artist colony it would eventually become. Instead, it was a somewhat rundown, working-class Sicilian neighborhood. For a starving young artist, that meant the rent was affordable and Williams relished being able to sequester himself in the Quarter, whose rundown state he found charming and whose Old World ambience entranced him. One of his plays, <em>The Vieux Carré</em>, takes its title from the old French term for the Quarter, and he called the “old square” a “vagabond’s paradise,” a refuge for “fugitives from economic struggle” (qtd. In McKinney 52). Though he traveled a great deal in his life, Williams always returned to the Quarter and indeed called it his “spiritual home” (qtd. 51). Both Williams’ writing and authentic self were able to blossom in New Orleans. He was a Southerner, and no doubt New Orleans’s southern-ness appealed to him; but beyond that, he was overwhelmed by how much New Orleans – and the Quarter especially – differed from the rest of the South and, needless to say, from the rest of North America.</p>
<p>And New Orleans has, in turn, embraced Williams as a favorite son. Every year around Tennessee’s birthday of March 26th, a five-day festival of writerly arts, The Tennessee Williams & New Orleans Literary Festival, is held. </p>
<p>As well as finding in the Quarter the place where his artistic muse presided, Williams also found in it a place where he could come to terms with, and ultimately exult in, his personal sexuality. Tennessee was the grandson of an Episcopalian minister and he was raised in a manner he described as highly “puritanical.” At home it had been an unthinkable thought to consider that he might be gay. But in New Orleans, in his late twenties, he was finally able to acknowledge his same-sex preference and, more than that, grow out of guilt about it and live happily as a gay man in a place where not only starving artists, but also homosexuals could live relatively freely and openly. </p>
<p>His best-known and most controversial play, <em>A Streetcar Named Desire</em> (first staged in 1947), is set in the French Quarter. On the other hand, Suddenly, Last Summer is still set in New Orleans, but across Canal Street in what is known as the Garden District. (Indeed, we should note that when it was first staged in 1958, <em>Sudddenly, Last Summer</em> was grouped with another one-act play by Williams, with both subsumed under the title <em>Garden District</em>.) And we should clarify that while “the American section” on the uptown side of Canal was home to those descendants of freed slaves whom we have become acquainted with through Armstrong and company, it also contained white neighborhoods and parks of tremendous wealth and splendor, particularly in the vicinity of Tulane University. It is in one such Garden District home that <em>Suddenly, Last Summer</em> is set. </p>

<h3>The Gothic</h3>
<p>What you will find to be the exotic nature (both literal and figurative) of the Venable mansion in <em>Suddenly</em> plays off the reputation for exoticism that New Orleans itself holds for much of the rest of the world. The sprawling, wildly furnished and intimidating family home of the Venables is a clue that, in this play, part of what’s at work is an engagement with the literary genre known as <em>the Gothic</em>. In fact, <em>Suddenly Last Summer</em> is often classed under the rubric “Southern gothic,” a term denoting fiction that is Gothic in quality but set in the American South. </p>
<p>The distinction is made because the genre of Gothic fiction began in Europe and Britain during what today we call the Romantic period – a time of political, philosophical and artistic upheaval that is seen as beginning in the later 1700s and continuing on in to the mid-1800s. The earliest Gothic novels were written and published in the late 1700s and quickly found huge, enthusiastic audiences of readers, most of whom were middle-class women. (In addition, some of the earliest and most successful Gothic novels were written <em>by</em>> women.) The genre got its name from the fact that many of the stories were set in and around castles, cathedrals and ruins that dated from the late Middle Ages and which featured Gothic architecture. Within such towering, gloomy spaces a story was typically set that featured such “dark” elements as hauntings, ghosts and social outcasts as well desperate chases and fearsome secrets. The protagonist of the story was often a young, virtuous woman who came into contact with a haughty, mysterious older man (usually a nobleman) about whom the young woman felt both attraction and repulsion. </p>
<p>I do not mean that you should read <em>Suddenly, Last Summer</em> strictly as a Gothic tale, but rather as a play that can be said to partake, in part, of that genre.</p>

<h3>Intertexts</h3>
<p>Finally, about the intertextual element I mentioned earlier. Two key intertexts of <em>Suddenly, Last Suymmer</em>, come from ancient Greek culture and are closely related to each other. The first is the tragedy <em>The Bacchae</em>, written by the Athenian master playwright Euripides around 400 B.C.E., a riveting play that revolves around the cult of the Greek god Dionysus (known to the Romans as Bacchus; hence the term “Bacchae” for his female followers). The other is the Greek myth of Orpheus, which I’ll briefly summarize. </p>
<p>Orpheus was a demi-god, which is to say he was the child of one of the Nine Muses and a mortal king. He was gifted with tremendous skills as a poet and musician. When he sang and played his lyre, it’s said that all of nature – not just human beings, but animals, trees and stones – fell under his rapturous spell. He had many adventures and accompanied Jason and the Argonauts in search of the golden fleece. He was, however, unlucky in love. His young wife Eurydice, to whom he was devoted, was killed by a snakebite and carried off to the underworld, the land of the dead. Enflamed with grief, Orpheus undertook his greatest challenge – he journeyed, as no living mortal had ever done, to the land of the dead to find his beloved. There, his singing and playing so charmed the attendants of the underworld – including the god Hades, king of the underworld – that he was permitted to take Eurydice back with him to the surface of the earth and the land of the living.  </p>
<blockquote>Hades set one condition, however: upon leaving the land of death, both Orpheus and Eurydice were forbidden to look back. The couple climbed up toward the opening into the land of the living, and Orpheus, seeing the Sun again, turned back to share his delight with Eurydice. In that moment, she disappeared. (Britannica)</blockquote>
<p>Despondent at this greatest of all losses, Orpheus gave up poetry and music and, in some accounts, love itself. This led to Orpheus being punished by the god Dionysus, who set a group of his wild, orgiastic female followers, called maenads or Bacchae, upon Orpheus. When possessed by the intoxicating spirit of their god, the maenads had superhuman strength and, in the midst of a Dionysian orgy, they tore Orpheus limb from limb. His severed head kept singing, though, and eventually floated to the isle of Lesbos, where it remained for ages on the beach, prophesying and making music. The ritual act of tearing a living creature limb from limb was called sparagmos in ancient Greek. Though we don’t have space to develop the matter here, Greek myth holds that the god Dionysus was himself torn limb from limb as a child, only to be reborn. Ritual dismemberment was a practice reportedly engaged in by followers of Dionysus and Orpheus (who later became the focus of a religion himself) and it can be said to have a metaphorical as well literal significance. </p>
<p>But enough of such ancient sagas. Let us head up the Garden District. </p>
