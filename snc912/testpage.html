    In this module we focus on the second and final portion of The Awakening, which is full of twists and turns event-wise, all of which sweep Edna on an emotional roller-coaster ride to a striking and ambiguous ending. Since you’re almost certainly reading this introduction before you read the novel’s second portion, I’m not going to discuss that second portion at any length (though I will pose some questions and mark out some themes for you to keep in mind). 
</p>
<p>
    But in this intro to the novel’s concluding portion I would mostly like to raise and flesh out some key issues that informed the first 16 chapters which you read for Module 7. 
</p>
<p>
    Since I concluded our Introduction to Module 7 discussing music, I would like to pick up there. As you well know, we learn in chapter IX that Edna is very fond of music (and by this we mean instrumental music as opposed to songs). As many people do when listening to instrumental music, Edna conjures up – or allows the music to conjure up – very specific images in the mind’s eye. Perhaps because she is herself a visual artist, Edna experiences such visualizations with particular intensity; Chopin describes them almost as if they were paintings. But on the evening of the soirée when the reluctant master pianist Mademoiselle Reisz is persuaded to play, Edna experiences something else – something new – while taking in the music. Her standard response of conjuring visual images is disrupted:
</p>
<blockquote>
    The very first chords Mademoiselle Reisz struck upon the piano sent a keen tremor down Mrs. Pontellier’s spinal column. It was not the first time she had heard an artist at the piano. Perhaps it was the first time she was ready, perhaps the first time her being was tempered to take an impress of the abiding truth.<br />
    <br />
    She waited for the material pictures which she thought would gather and blaze before her imagination. She waited in vain. She saw no pictures of solitude, of hope, of longing, or of despair. But the very passions themselves were aroused within her soul, swaying it, lashing it, as the waves daily beat upon her splendid body. She trembled, she was choking, and the tears blinded her. (chapter 9)
</blockquote>
<p>
    Experiencing the music in this new way – being sent into transports of ecstasy by it – is, so to speak, the keynote to a night that will prove transformative for Edna. As the night goes on, she swims competently for the first time in her life; not only that, she pushes herself to the limit swimming in the Gulf waters and nearly drowns in doing so, but saves herself. And then she spends much of the rest of this night of triumph with Robert, who tells her, in his playful way, about the mystic Spirit of the Gulf who always appears on this one night of the year – August 28th -- to bestow a blessing on one mortal woman. Finally, when she returns home to their cottage, rather than sleeping in the Pontelliers’ marriage bed, Edna dozes luxuriantly in the outdoor hammock until the wee hours.
</p>
<p>
    The next morning, Edna, as part of a group from Grand Isle, make the trek to the Chênière Caminada for mass. Here, Edna encounters for the first time Mariequita, the lower-class Mexican girl she suspects is the object of Robert’s affection and she eyes the innocent young woman suspiciously. Along for the ride too are those unnamed characters who are often found in the background of the novel’s scenes, but never in the foreground – “the lovers,” and “the lady in black.” 
</p>
<p>
    It’s on this trip that Robert, again in his playful way, suggests that he and Edna travel further, to Grand Terre, to hunt for buried treasure. (This is a reference to the Baratarian pirates discussed in Module 7.) After their long day, rather than making the trip home, Edna sleeps over at Madame Antoine’s, where she bathes, sleeps, bathes some more and then eats heartily. In bathing and dressing, Edna exults in what she finds to be the marvelous sensuality of her own body, a very un-puritanical preoccupation and another in this particular weekend’s list of new, blossoming experiences for our protagonist. It is as if she is in a light trance brought on by the powerful personal experiences she had on August 28th. When Robert finds her awake, she asks how long she has been asleep. As if he were addressing sleeping beauty, Robert replies, “You have slept precisely 100 years’ (chapter XIII). And Chopin is here deliberately evoking fairy tales as a metaphor for the romantic horizons that seem to be opening for Edna. And yet, this turns out to be the peak preceding a fall, which comes when Edna learns, most abruptly and second-hand, that Robert has suddenly decided to leave for Mexico. This event, coming so hotly on the heels of her awakening of August 28th, will send Edna on a new and circuitous course, one which holds out prospects of further awakening (and perhaps more crashes too). 
</p>

<h3>Music, unmediated</h3>
<p>
    But to return to the music of the soirée – or rather, Edna’s newfound way of experiencing it: In her previous way of listening, we might say that the music was mediated for Edna by pictures. That is, she did not experience the music directly, but rather through the medium of pictures. But on this singular night, the pictures are, so to speak, pushed out of the way, so that nothing comes between Edna and “the very passions themselves.”
</p>
<p>
    Here, Chopin is touching on a theme in aesthetics. The word “aesthetic” can have different meanings (though they almost all have something to do with the arts or with notions of what is good in the arts), but aesthetics (plural) refers to a branch of philosophy – the branch of philosophy that studies beauty and explores questions such as what is beauty? What things can we/should we call beautiful? How do we know or determine what counts as beautiful? And is there some single, universal standard of beauty, or is it, as the saying goes, strictly in the eye of the beholder? 
</p> 
<p>
    The 19th century German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer (1788-1860) was quite interested in aesthetics (among other matters) and he ranked the various art forms – literature, painting, sculpture, etc. – finding music to be the absolute best and purest of all. For Schopenhauer, this was because music did not refer to, represent or, so to speak, point to anything beyond itself. All the other art forms referred to or represented the world or part of the world, such as, say, the natural landscape in painting, or the history of empires in, say, epic poems. But music did no such thing. The notes, melodies, chords and rhythms of instrumental music point to nothing beyond themselves; they are, instead, compete in themselves and, like pure mathematics, form a completely self-enclosed system. Musical compositions don’t “mean” anything, somewhat in the way that a sunset doesn’t “mean” anything, but simply is. They exist not as representations of things in the world, but as things in the world on a par with, say, sunsets, redwood trees, and perhaps even human beings themselves. (We should note that art forms such as abstract painting, a visual art which intends to be non-representational, were unknown in the 19th century.) So because music was self-sufficient, had no connection to anything outside itself (and also could, Schopenhauer thought, be incredibly beautiful), it was, for Schopenhauer, the highest of all – the supreme art form. 
</p>
<p>
    And from the viewpoint of Schopenhauer, when Edna allows pictures of the real world to mediate her experience of music, she is missing out. She is listening to music in exactly the wrong way because she is not honoring music’s true nature – its autonomy in relation to “the real world” – and is depriving herself of the greatest experience of beauty available to human beings.
</p>
<p>
    But on the night of the ball, as we’ve noted, Edna transcends her old, pictorial way of listening – her visually mediated approach. Instead, she goes beyond that and “experiences the very passions themselves” (72). This is Kate Chopin’s way of saying that Edna has the kind of experience Schopenhauer prized, where the music is experienced as a thing-in-itself. And by connecting with this phenomenon which is gloriously disconnected from the physical, natural world, Edna is herself transported, ecstatically, out of the world – for a brief, shining moment, at least. 
</p>
<p>
    In Schopenhauer’s own words,<br/>
    <blockquote>
        Music does not express this or that particular and definite joy, this or that sorrow, or pain, or horror, or delight, or merriment, or peace of mind; but joy, sorrow, pain, horror, delight, merriment, peace of mind themselves, to a certain extent in the abstract, their essential nature, without accessories, and therefore without their motives. Yet we completely understand them in this extracted quintescence. (qtd. in Harper’s)
    </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
    Sigh. As we’ve said, this particular breakthrough on Edna’s part is the harbinger of several more to come. The question will be: Having broken free of so many oppressive constraints, does Edna have what her friend and mentor Mademoiselle Reisz effectively describes as the ironclad constitution necessary to survive and flourish as a true artist – as, we might say, a bird without a cage?
</p>
<p>
    And one further point: The Schopenhauerian conception of music we’ve just outlined is of course not the only conception of music we’ve encountered in this course. In fact, it’s a perfect statement of what Thomas Brothers has called the Eurocentric conception of music as an end-in-itself to be appreciated soberly and worshipfully, in a space – typically, a concert hall – that mimics the setup of a cathedral. As we learned in Modules 1-3, African as well as African American conceptions of music are, or have been, very different; they certainly were in Louis Armstrong’s time and place. There, music was, as we know, something played, often as not, in the open air; something that encouraged and welcomed vigorous participation by listeners, such that it did not draw a bright line between performer and audience; and something not turned inward on itself but rather outward toward the community where, rather than existing as a sacred relic with no everyday utility, it performed an important social function, which was to make people feel good, make them dance, and bring them together in recognition of their common emotions and shared humanity.
</p>
<p>
    And as Brothers and I have suggested before, this speaks to an irony in both the history of jazz and the career of Louis Armstrong. For most of the New Orleanian features of music we have just described – which, of course, were crystallized in early jazz – were dropped or lost as the years went by and the music called jazz gained in recognition. Today, jazz is widely described as African American classical music, is appreciated in worshipful silence by listeners who remain politely in their seats, with such seats in turn filling out a concert hall (or its nightclub equivalent). Moreover, the focus is not on collective or group improvisation but rather on the single, virtuosic solo performer. That soloist does indeed improvise, but he/she does so while standing out from, and usually literally in front of, the rest of the band. It’s a far cry from Joe Oliver’s desire to hear everybody playing together, all the time. And, as we’ve learned, the final irony is that the prototype for this virtuosic, ultra-masterful jazz soloist turned out to be Oliver’s very own protégé, the grown-up Louis Armstrong.

<h3>Other passages of note</h3>
<p>
    Some other passages from chapters I-XVI you should keep mind as you read to the novel’s end include the following: 
</p>
<p>
    In chapter VII, Edna describes the green meadows of Kentucky from her childhood, which were like an ocean she found herself swimming through. She observes to herself that this summer, at Grand Isle, it is as if she were back there, in the tall, wonder-laden meadows of her younger days. In this chapter, she also recollects what she describes as her youthful “infatuations” (chapter VII) – the dashing cavalry officer; the young gentleman; and the great tragedian (i.e. stage actor) who may well have been, or modelled by Chopin on, Edwin Booth, the celebrated American stage actor of the mid-19th century (whose brother, John Wilkes Booth, assassinated Abraham Lincoln). All these infatuations were one-sided, existing entirely, or almost entirely, in Edna’s mind (or heart); she was much too young and shy to make overtures to such men who were older than she (and, in the case of the tragedian, never came within miles of Edna’s home). 
</p>
<p>
    When the customary time to get married came, Edna married Léonce Pontellier not out of infatuation or romantic love, but out of practicality and a certain narcissism. It was a “marriage of convenience” in that social customs and gender roles dictated that she marry someone and Léonce was well situated financially; of course, as an added plus, he admired Edna immensely. However, we learned in last week’s reading and will learn even moreso in this week’s, that what Leonce expected of Edna was, above all, that she conform to – indeed, embrace enthusiastically -- the role of an upper middle-class Creole wife; that is to say, that she be a breeder and a “mother woman” (to use Edna’s term); a proper homemaker and helpmate to her husband; and a kind of trophy – another one of his fine bourgeois possessions.  
</p>

<h3>The meaning of “dilemma”</h3>
<p>
    Quite unexpectedly – given the stage of life she’s now in and what seems the initial unseriousness of Robert in flirting with her – Edna finds herself falling in love with a man who’s neither too old nor too distant, but who is, rather, right by her side much of the time. This creates a dilemma for Edna, one she will attempt, at times quite vigorously, to work out in the second portion of the novel. And in this regard, let us pause over that word “dilemma’ and its actual meaning. We use it quite commonly, of course, but it means something more than just a “problem.” A dilemma is a special kind of problem in which one has to choose between two things, both of which are “good.”  So:
    <ol>
        <li>It is good to be faithful in marriage and an attentive mother to one’s children.</li>
        <li>It is good to find true love and to be able to act autonomously as a free human being.</li>
    </ol>
</p>
<p>
    Items a and b are, in Edna’s world at least, both considered highly valuable; each is a kind of “good.” The question is, when it comes to a conflict (which we sometimes aptly call “a crunch”) which of the two notions of good will win out? Which one will trump the other? Which one will you choose? Because it’s not a choice between one thing that’s obviously good and another which is obviously bad; it’s more complicated -- and  potentially more dangerous or destructive – than that. This why we sometimes speak of “being caught on the horns of a dilemma.” In that figure of speech, the idea is that one is being charged by a bull (with two horns, of course); one of the horns represents choice a and one of the horns represents choice b. If, as the bull charges you, you dodge to the right, you’re still likely to get stuck by the bull’s left horn; and if you dodge to the left, you’re still likely to get struck by the bull’s right horn. We have another colloquial saying which sums up nicely this situation: “You’re damned if you do and damned if you don’t.” 
</p>

<h3>Edna’s assertions</h3>
<p>That’s the kind of problem a dilemma is. And in this light, bear in mind something Edna says in passing to Adele in chapter 16, something which shocks Adele (whom we know from Edna to be the ideal “mother-woman”) to her core: “I would never sacrifice myself for my children.”</p>
<p>
    Regarding Léonce’s view, touched upon above, of his wife a) as needing, above all else, to behave “properly”; and b) as his property, observe closely the machinations he goes through as he begins to think Edna disturbed, as well as later, when Edna, as we say, makes her move. 
</p>
<p>
    And finally, regarding Edna’s move, I don’t want to give away too much about it here, but I want to shed light on what seem to be two a small details from the celebration Edna hosts once she has made her move. This evening turns out to be another of Edna’s triumphs and, as the center of attention, she is called by Mademoiselle Reisz “ma reine” (French for “my queen”). In the midst of the festivities, Robert’s mischievous younger brother Victor begins to sing a song which bothers Edna, such that she finally tells him emphatically to be quiet. The lyric, Chopin tells us, goes, “Si tu savis”. In English, that translates to “If you only knew.” 
</p>

<h3>Those two strange lines of verse</h3>
<p>
    Finally, at the same party, a guest named Gouvernail somewhat boozily recites two lines of cryptic-sounding verse:
    <blockquote>
        There was a graven image of Desire<br />
        Painted with red blood on a ground of gold. (chapter XXX)
    </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
    These lines come from a sonnet (a kind of 14-line poem) titled “A Cameo,” by the late Romantic author Algernon Charles Swinburne, a celebrated English poet of the mid-19th century. The entire poem is highly allegorical, which is to say that, in this case, it turns (through the figure of speech called “personification”) abstractions (such as “desire”) into beings, like humans or gods. Here is the full text, followed by a few remarks:
    <blockquote>
        There was a graven image of Desire<br />
Painted with red blood on a ground of gold<br />
Passing between the young men and the old,<br />
And by him Pain, whose body shone like fire,<br />
And Pleasure with gaunt hands that grasped their hire.<br />
Of his left wrist, with fingers clenched and cold,<br />
The insatiable Satiety kept hold,<br />
Walking with feet unshod that pashed the mire.<br />
The senses and the sorrows and the sins,<br />
And the strange loves that suck the breasts of Hate<br />
Till lips and teeth bite in their sharp indenture,<br />
Followed like beasts with flap of wings and fins.<br />
Death stood aloof behind a gaping grate,<br />
Upon whose lock was written Peradventure.<br />
    </blockquote>
</p>

<p>
    A “graven image” is a carved or “engraved” image; however, the term is also used in the Old Testament, where God instructs the Israelites that it is sinful to worship “graven images,” i.e., false gods carved out of wood or stone. So we might read the opening as speaking not of desire per se, but of a “graven,” and hence, false image of desire (a term which we can take to stand in for Eros, the Greek god of love, from whose name we derive the word “erotic”). “Ground” in “ground of gold” means “background,” so we have a perhaps false or inferior image of erotic love painted in blood on a background of gold. This image of Desire moves, like a person, through a kind of procession “between the young men and old,” and is accompanied by other personified abstractions – ideas made human-like by the device of allegory -- including Pain, Pleasure, Satiety and Hate. Swinburne is not painting a pretty picture here. All the personified abstractions are, despite their connection to something – Eros – which we might regard as one of humankind’s blessings, menacing in one way or another. They are compared to beasts and even vampires and appear to accompany the image of Desire in the way guards accompany prisoners. At the end of the procession, Death awaits before a gate marked “Peradventure,” a term which means “chance, doubt, or uncertainty.” 
</p>
<p>
    The linkage of Desire (or Eros) with Death is telling. In European Romantic literature of the late 17- and early 1800s, love – at least love of the burning, passionate kind – is typically linked with death. The Romantics saw love – again, love of the passionate, all-consuming type – as perhaps the greatest experience human beings could have. In this conception of love, the lovers are soul-mates: they are destined to be together, their spirits are so attuned to each other that they are often likened to brother and sister, and their love induces what we now know as the experience of mystical ecstasy – or, to use a term of Edna’s, “life’s delirium”(chapter VVIII). But in Romanticism, this transcendent, transformative experience of love always comes at a very high price. It as if the love of the soul-mates is so intense, so powerful -- so hot – that the world – and ordinary human existence – cannot comprehend it, cope with it or tolerate it. This kind of ecstatic desire elevates the couple far above the common world; in fact, it ultimately removes them to such an extent that they die in one way or another. The Germans even coined a word for this phenomenon (which is heavily dramatized in German Romantic art); that word is “liebestod,” and it literally means “love-death.”   
</p>
<p>
    Yet in his poem, Swinburne, while linking a certain kind of (perhaps inferior or poorly formed) desire with death, does not go the full Romantic route and equate it with death. The closing of the sonnet, with Death presiding over a gate whose name means “chance or uncertainty” leaves the question open. 
</p>
<p>
    The question for us, as readers of The Awakening, is: Does this seemingly passing allusion (a word that means “literary reference”) to Swinburne – and bear in mind that Chopin simply puts the poem’s first two lines in the mouth of an inebriated partygoer without naming either the poem or its author – have any significance for the larger story and for Edna?
