<p>
    In Module 7 here, we begin our study of a groundbreaking, controversial and superbly written short novel, The Awakening by Kate Chopin. We will conclude our reading of and work on the novel in Module 8.
</p>
<p>
    First published in 1899, The Awakening evoked a storm of controversy in its day. It was roundly condemned as immoral, sexually depraved and a threat to upstanding behavior and decorum in civilized society. And yet today the novel is regarded as a classic, particularly of feminist literature (even though in the 1890s, feminism was not a widely used term and the novel’s author, Kate Chopin, never described herself as such). The scandal practically ended the career of Chopin who, before publication of this particular novel, had enjoyed several years of success as a writer of short stories, many of them set in the bayou country of Louisiana that surrounds New Orleans. The kernel of the controversy – and here I don’t think I’m spoiling anything for you – is its depiction of its protagonist, Edna Pontellier, an upper-middle class woman from New Orleans who, among many other exploits, crosses certain middle-class moral boundary lines. The shocker, for the novel’s early critics, was that Chopin did not condemn such behavior, or, seemingly, pass any moral judgment on Edna for what she does. I hasten to add that The Awakening by no means reduces to Edna committing such transgressions; that was simply the point on which the novel’s early detractors seized. The novel is much better seen as a psycho-sociologically nuanced character study of a young woman who gradually (and profoundly) realizes she does not fit in with the social milieu in which she finds herself. And by constructing such a portrait, the novel implicitly ponders and critiques the very social milieu in question.
</p>
<p>
    One name for that social milieu is Creole, although here that term, which can have, as McKinney noted in Module 1, so many different meanings, does not refer to gens de couleur libres, the Creoles of Color with whom Armstrong and company had to contend. Racially speaking, all the main characters in The Awakening are white but refer to themselves as “Creoles,” and that’s because in this particular context the word denotes white people of French descent who were born in the New World. Nearly all the main characters are affluent and nearly all live in the French Quarter. The only exception, ethnically speaking, is Edna herself, who was born in Kentucky to an Anglo Protestant family and who married the Creole businessman Léonce Pontellier and moved with him to New Orleans. (By the way, since most of the characters in the story have French names, I have included a pronunciation guide at the end of this introduction.) Take note of how intensely status-conscious most of the Creoles who surround Edna are. 
</p>
<h3>Barataria</h3>
<p>
    Though most of the characters live in the French Quarter, much of the story takes place on Grand Isle, one of the Baratarian islands located 23 miles south of New Orleans. These affluent Creoles make it a practice to decamp with their families to a resort on Grand Isle for the duration of every summer. The other major Baratarian island is called Grand Terre, and some of the novel’s action takes place there as well. The islands make up the main portion of an area called Barataria Bay, and they provide the only separation between the bay and the Gulf of Mexico. 
</p>
<p>
    Much of Barataria consists of swampy marshland and in the early 1800s it was the main redoubt of Jean Lafitte and his band of pirates, briefly mentioned in Module 1. The so-called “Baratarian pirates” did not think of themselves as pirates, but rather as privateers, though the distinction can be murky. Basically a privateer is a sailor who conduct acts of piracy on behalf of, and under the flag of, a particular country. Thus, privateers operating under the sanction of, say, the French crown, would never attack or loot French shipping vessels; however, they would see English or Spanish ships as fair game. However, the extent to which Lafitte and his band acted strictly as privateers and not pirates per se is open to debate, given how much seafaring mayhem they engaged in and the amount of looting and smuggling they did. And though they were officially branded as wanted criminals by the governor of Louisiana, they had a shop in the French Quarter through which they regularly and profitably fenced their stolen wares. As we noted in Module 1, once Lafitte and his group joined the American side and fought valiantly in the battle of New Orleans, the state government’s attitude toward the Baratarian pirates changed. Today, much of Barataria is a nature preserve going by the name of Jean Lafitte Park. 
</p>
<p>
    In The Awakening, Edna and a friend sometimes kid about heading over to Grand Terre to search for buried gold. Though Chopin does not explain this, the characters are referring to the persistent legend that, somewhere on Grand Terre, Lafitte and company left buried treasure. 
</p>
<p>
    Another phenomenon to bear in mind while reading Chopin’s novel is the form of social organization called patriarchy. This term, as you may know, refers to a society which is hierarchical in gender terms, with men effectively ruling over women, both domestically and in the wider society, by holding wealth and the reins of power and so oppressing women. In such a social order, women are typically viewed as inferior creatures who (if viewed in a relatively positive light) are regarded as fragile and childlike or (if regarded in a relatively negative light) as dangerously irrational and sexually rampant. Patriarchy prescribes motherhood and domestic caretaking as the primary role of women and, needless to say, it has been part of the structure of all, or nearly all, Western societies for centuries.

<h3>Background on Kate Chopin</h3>
<p>
    Kate Chopin was born Katherine O'Flaherty in St. Louis, Missouri in 1850. Her father, Thomas O’Flaherty, was a well-to-do businessman who immigrated to America from Galway, in the west of Ireland. Her mother, Eliza Faris, came from the upper echelons of St. Louis’s French community and was descended from Louisiana creoles of French Canadian extraction.  
</p>
<p>
    In June 1870, 20-year old Kate married Oscar Chopin, a cotton broker from New Orleans and moved with him to the crescent city. Kate bore Oscar six children between 1871 and 1879. When Oscar’s cotton brokerage went benkrupt in 1879, the family moved to Cloutierville, in the heart of bayou Cajun country, where the Chopins managed some small plantations and a sundry store. When Oscar died in 1882, he left his wife with a mountain of debt. Kate gamely took on the role of manager of the family’s businesses but, ultimately unable to make a go of it, she sold the plantations and store in 1884. In the two years following her husband’s death, she is said to have also played the role of eligible widow and to have had a romantic involvement with a local married man. 
</p>
<p>
    When the Louisiana businesses failed, Kate and the children moved back to St. Louis and lived with her mother, who died a year later. This series of personal blows plunged the young widow into what we today would call depression. At this point, an unusual therapy was recommended by the family doctor, who suggested that Kate take up writing. The doctor thought this pursuit might prove both cathartic and remunerative. 
</p>
<p>
    By the early 1890s, Chopin was seeing her short stories and articles, some written for adults and some for children, published in a wide range of venues, from newspapers to literary magazines. In those days, if a writer published in such periodicals, he/she received a decent wage. In the later 1890s, she published two short story collections, Bayou Folk and A Night in Acadie, both featuring fictions about residents of Louisiana’s Cajun country (the word “Cajun” coming, as we have learned, from the French Acadian, shortened to ‘Cadian). Some of these stories dealt with controversial topics such as miscegenation (the word used at the time to mean interracial sexual relations), and often featured strong women who affirmatively expressed sexual desire. 
</p>
<p>
    Chopin’s first novel, At Fault, was published in 1890. Unlike her short story collections, it was not well received. And The Awakening, which, as we know, ignited a storm of controversy, was her second and final novel; in 1904, while visiting the St. Louis World’s Fair, she suffered a sudden stroke and died at the age of 54. 
</p>

<h3>Kate Chopin’s writing style</h3>
<p>
    Finally, in reading The Awakening, pay attention to, among other things, Chopin’s writing style. It is not sentimental in the manner of other Victorian-era fiction by American women writers. And, also unlike many Victorian era authors, both female and male, her narrative voice is not intrusive. That is, she does not, so to speak, take the reader aside and explain, point blank, what the characters’ behavior ultimately signifies or what their motives are or what their thoughts (which she traces out adroitly) mean. Her descriptions are realistic, but she is very good at choosing a single image – or sound, or gesture – to crystallize the crux of what’s going on at a particular juncture in the story. At the same time that she may highlight such an image, she, again, does not explain it the reader. One might she shows, rather than tells. In this, she is in tune not with the Victorian era of fiction writing from which she emerged, but rather the Modernist approach, which did not gain prominence until the early 20th century, after her death. Modernist fiction prizes a kind of understatement that seems pregnant with meaning, yet that meaning is not spelled out. It also values a certain respect for, and expectation of, the reader. Yes, the Modernist writer provides details, dialogue, inner monologue, description and action; however, she/he leaves it up to the reader to fill in, as it were, the blanks – to draw the inferences about what all that means within the story. In this writing style, as in her subject matter, Kate Chopin was ahead of her time.
</p>

<h3>Music in The Awakening </h3>
<p>
    Finally, a musical note: Kate Chopin was not related to the great 19th century Polish pianist and composer Frederic Chopin, yet Frederic Chopin’s music plays an important role in our novel. In chapter IX, Edna is deeply affected by hearing Mademoiselle Reisz play two Chopin pieces on the piano. Neither composition is named and instead, the novel concentrates on Edna’s response to the music. But to enhance your own experience of the story, I thought I would take an educated guess as to what the two musical selections in question might be. The first is familiar to Edna and is called by her “Solitude,” because, needless to say, that’s the mood the piece evokes for her. My nomination here would be Chopin’s Third Prelude in E Minor, heard here:

    And my nomination for the second piece, which is new to Edna and which carries her completely away, is Chopin’s Fantasie-Impromptu:

    Notice, by the way that, with pieces of music and musical performances such as these, we are far from the vernacular music of New Orleans we studied closely in our first few modules. The music referenced in The Awakening is not just Eurocentric, but literally European and is the type of music that would, of course, have been regarded as the only true music by upper-class Creoles of the type portrayed in the novel as well as the downtown Creoles of color who, as we have learned, were trained in the strict, Eurocentric tradition embodied by New Orleans’ French Opera House.
