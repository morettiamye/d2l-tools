<p>Your primary focus in this week/module is completing Assignment 6.1: Midterm Paper. I hope you find our very sparse menu of activities this week helpful as you work on that assignment. </p>
<p>Regarding that sparse Week 6 menu though, it consists almost entirely of your screening, at your convenience, a 1979 film; and this is yet another film about a hidden aspect of New Orleans culture made by and featuring New Orleanians. Moreover, like our other films of that type, this one is very little seen because it’s extremely rare and very hard to find. It’s called Piano Players Rarely Ever Play Together.</p>
<p>It’s also wonderful, as it sheds light on yet another extraordinary vein of NOLA vernacular music and some its most stellar exponents – in particular, Professor Longhair and Allen Toussaint. The film began, I think, with the filmmakers’ desire to make a film about Fess (whom we heard and read a bit about in Module 4). I think it occurred to the filmmakers that the best way to get Fess’s attention and consent was to go through Allen Toussaint, the brilliant composer/arranger/producer/sometime performer who became a behind-the-scenes star of the NOLA r&b scene starting in the late 50s and who, by the 70s, was producing and/or writing hit records for artists such as Labelle, Bonnie Raitt, and Paul McCartney & Wings. We met Toussaint in our Module 1 film Make It Funky.</p>
<p>Toussaint’s many talents and achievements aside, he is, at bottom, a piano player and he always looked to Fess as the master, calling Longhair “the Bach of rock.” So the filmmakers enlisted Toussaint to contact Fess. Then they realized that, despite Fess’s piano style being so unique (with its one-of-a-kind “Latin tinge”), even Fess had a mentor and he was the older boogie woogie pianist Tuts Washington. So at this point,  the filmmakers decided to make a movie about three interrelated generations of NOLA pianists, at least two of whom – Fess and Toussaint – will go down in popular/vernacular music history.</p>
<p>Moreover, the filmmakers got it in their heads that it would be great for the film if they could get three pianos – and the three pianists – in the same room to play together; hence the film’s title, because piano players indeed rarely ever play together. This is because a) pianos are quite large, as musical instruments go; and b) more to the point, the piano can be, and is often played as, a one-man orchestra, such that piano players often don’t play with other musicians at all and certainly not with other piano players. They get in each other’s way. Still, as you’ll see, the three ultimately made a go of it.</p>
<p>But the three-piano jam segment is the least significant thing about this film. Its main value is the spotlight it shines on Fess in his everyday life and musical milieu. There is much to be enjoyed in that and much to be learned about yet another branch of NOLA’s richly varied vernacular tradition. There is also a stunning surprise that occurred during the making of the film which took it in a different direction, but – no spoilers! – I’ll leave you to discover that.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, before you begin your screening, we’ll listen to Professor Longhair perform his signature tune, the inimitable, infectious “Tipitina”: </p>
